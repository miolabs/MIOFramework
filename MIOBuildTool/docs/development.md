# Development

## Getting started

Install the dependencies of the project, and start development.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Make it available in terminal

You can link your repository as if it was installed globally, with [npm-link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link)

```bash
npm link
miojs new -h
```

## How to debug

Set the environmental arguments in `.vscode/launch.json` and start the launch config.

## Write unit tests

## Publish to npm

To publish your first version to npm run:

```bash
tsc
npm publish
```

Now you're all set to go! Consume your library anywhere you want by running:

```bash
npm install --save hwrld
```

and consume it using

```typescript
import {HelloWorld} from 'hwrld'
HelloWorld.sayHello();
```
