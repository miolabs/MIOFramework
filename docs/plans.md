# Plan

## Key concepts

* One build tool for all.
* The build tool has to work with different project languages
  (php, javascript, typescript, swift)
* The build tool has to take care of the project specific checks, linting.
* The build tool has to be well documented
* The build tool has to have regression tests for modifications.
* The build tool has to read configurations from a config file
  * server data: port, sourcefolder
  * linter, if different from the original.
